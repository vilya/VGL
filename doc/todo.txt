TODO
====

- Make the current format-specific image loading functions public.
- Make it possible to register additional image loaders without changing the VGL code.

- Make the loadOBJ and loadPLY functions public.
- Make it possible to register additional geometry loaders without changing the VGL code.
- Add support for LWO files.
- Add support for .3ds files, using lib3ds: http://lib3ds.sf.net/

- Comment the code properly, in a structured format that Doxygen or something can use.
- Add a build target to generate the docs.

- Make sure we're only exporting the public symbols from the library.

- Get rid of the BaseCamera class (or gut it, so that it's better for subclassing).

- Get the ArcballCamera working *better* than the hacked-together camera in the
  OBJViewer.

- Scene graph classes
- Scene graph renderer
  - Walk the scene graph to build up a vector of render commands. Note that
    unloading a buffer / texture / shader should be a command too.
  - build up an adjacency matrix for dependencies between render commands.
  - Do a topological sort of the render commands.
  - Fuse commands where possible.
  - Sort the render commands to minimise the number of state changes & maximise
    reuse of buffers/textures.
